<p><img src="/image.jpg#floatright" alt=""></p>
<p>Well here is some stuff you might wanna know about me&hellip;</p>
<p>So, My name is Naman Malik, a <em>Part-time</em> electronics student and a <em>Full-time</em> <strong>Maker</strong>.  <br>
Though I am an <em>Electronics student</em> from profession but a <strong>Robotics Enthusiast</strong> by heart.
I have my Keen interests in <strong>Robotics, ROS, IOT</strong> and developing a taste in <strong>Computer Vision</strong>.  <br>
Driven by the idea of <strong>Project-based Learing</strong>, Eager to tinker with and learn about new <em>Tech</em>
and always ready to get my hand dirty on new projects - be it <em>Hardware</em> or <em>Software</em></p>

<h2 id="i-arduino">I, Arduino</h2>
<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p><strong>Arduino Day</strong> is a worldwide birthday celebration of Arduino â€“ organized directly by the community, or by the Arduino team. It brings people together to share their experiences and learn more about the open-source platform.</p>
<p>So this year, I coordinated with <strong>HatchnHack</strong> organized the <strong>I, Arduino</strong> event to acknowledge the open-source Arduino community who encouraged the people to make countless exciting projects over the years.</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<p>Some of my Projects over time :D  fot the arduino day.

</p>
<p>Many makers joined both online and offine to celebrate our beloved arduino&rsquo;s B&rsquo;day. Many students from High School, Collages and Universities came together and participated in various competitions, talks and discussions with great enthusiasm
and showcased their arduino projects.</p>
<p>Even my younger brother in 9th standered asked me to help on his project which lead him winning the best use-case award for the main event.</p>

<h3 id="story-behind-it">Story behind it</h3>
<p>So, <strong>Arduino day</strong> is on it&rsquo;s way, and I was thinking that an arduino based attraction is needed.
Well, I have seen people making these <strong>LED matrix</strong> and doing cool stuff with it like -  <br>
<strong>Display simple images and pattarns,  <br>
Audio Visualizer,     <br>
Playing 8-bit games etc.</strong>  <br>
So, a thought came to mind, why not make it into a table so it can be people attraction as well.<br>
Alright, we have got a project but how to proceed with it as multiplexing is out the question as it would be real mess and a huge amount pins would be needed.
Well, Here is where Neopixel LED&rsquo;s and Fast LED library came the rescue. Also a huge thanks to HATCHNHACK and Jasmeet Sigh to help bringing this to life.
The amazing thing about Neopixel LED is that we only need to connect VCC, Ground and data pin to the controller and multiple RGB LED&rsquo;s can be controlled with only one data pin which can be programmed using the Fast Led library using simple functions.</p>

<h2 id="eyantra-finals">Eyantra Finals</h2>
<p>The <strong>Eyantra Robotics competition</strong> has finally came to an end.</p>
<h3 id="checkout-the-full-finals-timestamp-4730---11500">Checkout the full finals (timestamp 47:30 - 1:15:00)</h3>

<p>It was an amazing journey of 6 and a half moths - Developing Stacks, Fixing infinite bugs and encountering randon errors leading to sleepless nights and endless calls figuring out the ultimate question &ldquo;WHY?????&rdquo;  <br>
Well, it was all for a greater good as the struggle lead us to the finals.
Also, I would aslo thank my team - Jasmeet Singh and Manav Sethi as if it was not out team effort, it would have been a nighmare.
Regardless of the technical skills like <strong>ROS</strong> and Different other stack EYRC has also taught us a lot about managment skills as how to plan before executing, manage multiple projects at the same time and the most important - <strong>NEVER GIVE UP</strong>!
We were amazed to see the great robotics projects going on in industries and universities and the amazing robotics culture in different collages accross the nation.
I would recommend every Robotics enthusiast to at least participate once as it not only teaches you about robotics but prepares you for the real world.</p>
